Download the project, double click on the main HTML file to run all the tests using Mocha in the browser.

[Here](http://muzietto.github.io/kolosso-eventer/) is a presentation using an interactive sandbox to try out the code. You may have to click a couple of times before GitHub displays the page correctly.
